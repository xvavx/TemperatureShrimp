Welcome to my program, i tried my best to complete it.
I hope it is successful with doing what it's asked.

Pre requisites to be able to run the program
You must have this packages installed in order to be able to run the program
> pip install requests beautifulsoup4

>>>>>>>>>>>>How to run the program.<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
First download the source code to your computer.
Open the command prompt on windows, or the terminal on either mac or linux.
On your cmd/terminal type "cd 'file path'" - eg. cd C:\Users\YOUR-USER\IdeaProjects\PythonChallengeVQ\
Make sure cmd/terminal displays the correct directory.

Type python main.py to execute the program.
To run a unit test you must type python -m unittest TestConsumer.py

>>>>>>>>>>>How to add more links<<<<<<<<<<<<

You can open the urls.txt file and add as many urls as you wish.

>>>>>>>>>>Difficulties and issues<<<<<<<<<<<

The unittest is scuffed because i didn't quite grasp the idea behind those yet. I had to learn from scratch and i don't
like the code i made.
If possible i really would like to learn more about unittests, at the moment this was my first ever try at those.
I have to admit that a lot of the unittest code is copied and was adapted to my code. that was a challenge by it self.

Another difficulty was python in general, since i never really used python outside of somewhat basic operations, i had
to learn about a lot of things. It's quite easy to learn, and i was very impressed with how little code i had to write
to make the same things that could be done in 200 lines of java.

This process took me around 8h to complete including the studying during the challenge.
Stackoverflow was my closest friend, and some udemy teachers on youtube to help with the more basics of python.
I hope to work more on python in general so i can grasp everything.
